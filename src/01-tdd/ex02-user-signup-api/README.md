# User Signup API

We want to recreate an API system that receives user data that we want
to persist on our system. Related to the prices of our provider we will not
be able to have a test database, so we will need to work with a Mock. Create the
flow of receiving user information (email, for example), validating it (”Is it a
valid value?”) and persisting it in the database. Keep in mind all the SOLID principles.

Once it’s done, we will add one additional validation: What happens when the user
already exists in the system?
